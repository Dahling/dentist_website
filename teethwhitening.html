      <h3>Get a Brighter Smile with Professional Whitening</h3>
      <h4 class="lighter">Are your teeth yellow or discolored? Are you embarrassed when you see pictures of yourself? Professional teeth whitening is an affordable, non-invasive solution. You can get brighter teeth in a way that fits your budget and your lifestyle!</h4>
      <h3>Why is Dentist Supervised Whitening Better?</h3>
      <h4 class="lighter">Although teeth whitening kits are available at drugstores, they are not as safe and effective as professional whitening. There are many benefits to having a dentist supervise your teeth whitening:</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <h3>Preliminary Oral Exam</h3>
        <li>We will take into consideration your medical history, health problems, and the condition of your teeth before recommending teeth whitening. It is not safe for everyone. We will discuss your expectations and see if whitening will meet your needs. There are other options which may work better in your case.</li>

        <h3>Professional Cleaning</h3>
        <p>It is recommended that you have a professional dental cleaning before any teeth whitening procedure. We want you to have visible and long-lasting results.</p>
        <h3>Customized Whitening Trays</h3>
        <p>We can custom-make whitening trays that fit your teeth perfectly, so the peroxide bleaching gel is concentrated in the right places.</p>
        <h3>Professional Monitoring and Followup</h3>
        <p>We will check on your progress and your results, making sure your teeth are responding to the prescribed concentration of whitening and your gums are not irritated. We will look at your whitening tray to ensure it is in good condition and still has a good fit. We will also advise you about after-care to keep your teeth whiter longer.</p>

      <h3>What Kind of Teeth Whitening do You Offer?</h3>
      <h4>We offer in-office and at-home whitening solutions for patients looking for brighter teeth that will last for years.</h4>
      <h4>Opalescence is a professional tray-based teeth whitening systems made for at-home application. With versatile options for your individual smile, you will get the results you are looking for. We make a custom whitening tray for you and send you home with the right concentrations of gel for daytime or nighttime whitening. Opalescence is gentle on your gums and teeth, but it is effective enough to make a big difference in your smile!</h4>
      <h4>Our in-office teeth-whitening, Philips Zoom! WhiteSpeed, uses a special light to activate a special bleaching gel that can improve the brightness of your teeth by up to eight shades. This whitening method is the latest treatment available in dentistry and can be completed in just one visit. In fact, patients can whiten their teeth in less than one hour.</h4>
      <h4>Philips Zoom! WhiteSpeed uses an LED light that is proven to be 100 percent more intense than its competitorsâ€™ whitening lights. The light combines with a pH booster ingredient in the teeth bleaching treatment to provide quick and beautiful results. Whitening treatments, even those properly monitored by oral health professionals, can cause tooth and gum sensitivity, but most of our patients who receive the Philips Zoom! WhiteSpeed treatment experience little to no sensitivity.</h4>
      <h3>Teeth Whitening Alternatives</h3>
      <h4>If you or one of our dentists determine that teeth whitening is not a good option for you, do not lose heart. There are several cosmetic procedures that can improve the look of your smile without bleaching. For instance, if your teeth are extremely dark or discolored, one effective way to a brighter smile is porcelain veneers.</h4>
      <h4>Veneers cover the front surfaces of the teeth and can be colored to hide many imperfections, including discoloration. You can have brighter teeth with veneers. Crowns are another solution to change the color and appearance of imperfect teeth. Crowns cover the whole visible portion of the tooth at and above the gum line.</h4>
