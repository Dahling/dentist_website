        <h3 class="matt">
          I grew up in Lake Oswego and graduated from Lakeridge and Linfield, followed by Oregon Health Science University. As a patient, I grew up going to see Dr. Eckmann, and he’s one of the main reasons I went into the dentistry field. Being active and involved in the community, along with the ability and time to help people with kindness and compassion, were things I wanted to be able to do. Having worked in a few different states through the years, with many other doctors, I’ve been able to continue learning and honing my professional skills to most effectively treat patients. I’m a member of the American Dental Association, as well as the Oregon Dental Association in both Clackamas and Multnomah County.</h3>
