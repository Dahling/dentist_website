      <h3>Permanent Replacement Teeth</h3>
      <h4>Are you embarrassed to smile? Do you have trouble chewing because you are missing teeth? Dental implants are a strong, attractive, and permanent solution to consider. If you are in good overall health, you may be a good candidate for dental implants. Our doctors have years of implant experience. We both surgically place the implants and restore them in our office.</h4>

        <h3>What is a Dental Implant?</h3>
        <h4>A single dental implant is a permanent tooth replacement option that has three parts: the implant, the abutment, and the crown.</h4>
        <div class="indent">
          <h4>IMPLANT</h4>
          <p>A small open screw, usually made of titanium, that is surgically implanted into the jaw bone. It is a replacement tooth root.</p>
          <h4>ABUTMENT</h4>
          <p>A post that fits into the implant to attach and support the crown.</p>
          <h4>CROWN</h4>
          <p>The replacement tooth that attaches to the abutment. It is the only part of the dental implant that is visible above the gum line.</p>
        </div>

      <h3>The Implant Process</h3>
      <h4>The first step is to surgically implant a titanium replacement root into the jawbone. Then, there is a period of several months when the jaw bone heals around the implant, called osseointegration. During this time you will have a temporary bridge or denture, so you can chew.</h4>
      <h4>Finally, a post (called an abutment) is inserted into the titanium root and capped with a crown. We call the final step, when you have a permanent replacement tooth placed, a “restoration” of the implant. If you are having more than one tooth replaced, the restoration process will include placing a custom-made bridge or a permanent implant-retained denture.</h4>

      <h3 style="text-align: center;">What are Some Benefits of Dental Implants?</h3>
      <h3>A Permanent Solution</h3>
      <h4>Implants are a life-changing solution that will save you from going without your teeth or even having dentures. They stay put without adhesives or clasps. Since they become integrated into your bone, they do not shift or slide like dentures can.</h4>
      <h3>Easy Care</h3>
      <h4>Teeth implants are easy to take care of. You just brush and floss like you do your regular teeth, and have routine checkups.</h4>
      <h3>Freedom to Eat</h3>
      <h4>Dental implants restore your freedom to eat what you like and allow you to enjoy your food again. They restore 90% of your bite strength, feeling and functioning just like natural teeth. You no longer have to choose soft foods that are easy to chew or avoid foods that get caught in your dentures. You can enjoy a steak for a special occasion and eat crunchy snacks and vegetables. Being able to make healthier choices makes a big impact on your nutrition and your overall health.</h4>
      <h3>Live Longer and Better</h3>
      <h4>Implants give you back the ability to chew, speak, and smile with confidence. You will enjoy eating and spending time with people more when you are not self-conscious about missing teeth or dentures that can slide around and even come out. Your quality of life will improve dramatically. Not only that, you may actually live longer.</h4>
      <h4>Studies show that people who lose their teeth, and do not replace them, shorten their lifespan by as much as 10 years. With dental implants procedure, there is a decrease in the occurrence of gum disease, which has been linked to diabetes and heart disease. There is a definite connection between a healthy mouth and a healthy body.</h4>
      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Look Younger</h2>
      <h3>Teeth implants</h3>
      <h4>Help to maintain the integrity of your jaw bone and facial structure. Keeping the framework intact prevents a sunken facial appearance, which happens when you lose your teeth. Replacing missing teeth does not just improve your smile, it can make you look younger and improve your overall appearance. When you know you look good, you feel good! Get your self-confidence back!</h4>
