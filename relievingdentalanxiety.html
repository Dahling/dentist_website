      <h3>Are you afraid to go to the dentist?</h3>
      <h4>You are not alone. Many people struggle with anxiety, especially about getting dental work done. You may be a little nervous, fearing the unknown, or you may be so gripped with fear that you have put off going to the dentist for a long period of time. The fact that you are even considering coming to see us may be a huge step for you. We know that choosing to do the best thing for your oral health takes courage. We understand. Your fear of dentist will not be belittled; it will be carefully considered in your treatment plan.</h4>
      <h3 style="font-style: italic;">“I Haven’t Been to the Dentist in Years”</h3>
      <h4>There are many reasons people avoid the dentist. More often than not, the real reason is that most people see going to the dentist as a very unpleasant experience. Whether you have absorbed the stereotype of dentistry from movies or TV that going to the dentist is always painful, or you have bad memories from dental visits in your past, it can be hard to overcome your aversion. Sometimes the only thing that motivates people to finally come in is dental pain or an emergency. If that is your situation, do not delay any longer. You will not be lectured or made to feel worse.</h4>
      <h3>How We Help Alleviate Anxiety</h3>
      <div class="indent">
        <h3>Our Compassionate Staff</h3>
        <h4>We will welcome you and help you get relief from the dental pain and anxiety you may be having. We help fearful patients all the time, and we know what works to make our patients feel more comfortable.</h4>
        <h3>Private Operatories</h3>
        <h4> When you are feeling vulnerable, and maybe even self-conscious, the last thing you want is to go through something that makes you nervous with others looking on. Your privacy and sense of peace and security are important to us.</h4>
        <h3>Sedation Dentistry</h3>
        <h4>The ability to sedate patients has made dentistry more accessible to those who struggle with fear. Before we do anything, we will spend some time gathering medical history and discussing your anxiety level about the procedure you need before deciding which level of sedation you may need. All of our sedation levels are safe, and you will be closely monitored throughout. Our staff is highly trained and certified to administer and monitor the three sedation methods we offer.</h4>
        <h3>Nitrous Oxide</h3>
        <h4>Also known as laughing gas, nitrous oxide is administered through a small rubber inhaler over your nose. This level of sedation will make you feel very relaxed, but you will remain conscious. It is most often used for anxious patients undergoing minor dental procedures. When you are finished, the effects of nitrous wear off within minutes.</h4>
        <h3>Oral Conscious Sedation</h3>
        <h4>For a deeper level of conscious sedation than nitrous oxide, a pill is taken orally prior to your procedure to help you relax. You are still aware of your dental appointment, but you are more relaxed and may even become very sleepy. Oral sedation is used to help fearful patients, those who have a sensitive gag reflex, and for short procedures.</h4>
        <h3>I.V. Sedation</h3>
        <h4>A quick and predictable sedation option, we can control the level of sedation throughout your procedure. When patients have a moderate or severe fear of dental procedures, I.V. Sedation is a wonderful solution. It enables us to put you to sleep within a minute, so you can get your dental work done without having to battle fear the entire time. We are able to get more completed in one visit. You will be able to receive treatment without pain and with no memory of the sights, smells, and noises of your dental visit. I.V. sedation is used primarily for more complex procedures or those that require extended time to complete.</h4>
